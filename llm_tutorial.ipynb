    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Are LLMs?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Large Language Models (LLMs)** are machine learning models trained on massive text corpora. They predict the next token in a sequence based on context, making them powerful pattern-recognition tools for generating human-like text. However, they do not understand meaning or possess reasoning capabilities—their output is probabilistic, not factual by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompting and Prompt Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompts** are structured inputs that tell an LLM what to do. A well-crafted prompt can significantly influence the quality, accuracy, and usefulness of the model's response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompts generally consist of three key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instruction\n",
    "\n",
    "The **instruction** specifies the task or behavior expected from the model. It can be a simple question, a directive, or even a persona setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- “Generate a list of known malicious domains associated with the Qakbot malware family.”\n",
    "- “Write a poem about the Qakbot malware family.”\n",
    "- “Produce a sonnet about my love of Franklin’s BBQ.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context** includes relevant information provided to the model to help it complete the instruction. This is particularly important for specialized or domain-specific use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of context:**\n",
    "- Extracted text from a PDF or website\n",
    "- Lists of known facts or structured datasets\n",
    "- Internal business knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "Context is critical when the model lacks the necessary background knowledge. It also enables **in-context learning** and is foundational to **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** systems.\n",

    "#### Output Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining the **output format** ensures the model returns a response in a structure that's compatible with downstream processing or presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- JSON/JSONL for programmatic consumption\n",
    "- Markdown for documentation or emails\n",

    "- Be explicit and unambiguous in your instructions.\n",
    "- Focus on what you want, not just what to avoid.\n",
    "- Supply sufficient context for the model to reason accurately.\n",
    "- Specify format, tone, language, or response length as needed.\n",
    "- Iterate and refine—prompt design is an interactive process.\n",
    "- Be cost-conscious—longer prompts and responses mean higher token usage.\n",

    "## Core LangChain Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/) is a modular framework for building generative AI applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It simplifies the development of multi-step pipelines, retrieval-augmented workflows, and agent-based reasoning systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### LangChain Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain provides key building blocks for LLM applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prompt templates** for reusability and structure\n",
    "- **Memory** for multi-turn interactions\n",
    "- **Tools** to access external data sources\n",
    "- **Chains** to compose tasks in sequence or branching logic\n",
    "- **Agents** for dynamic tool use and reasoning\n",
    "- **Document loaders, chunkers, and retrievers** for knowledge ingestion\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt Templates\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt templates** allow you to define reusable prompts with variables. This is essential for consistent prompt formatting in production use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\n",
    "\n",
    "template = \"Generate a list of domains associated with {malware_family}\"\n",
    "prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template)\n",
    "prompt.format(malware_family=\"Qakbot\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are inherently **stateless**, meaning they do not retain context between interactions. LangChain provides memory modules such as `ConversationBufferMemory` that persist prior messages and automatically re-inject them into prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory\n",
    "\n",
    "memory = ConversationBufferMemory()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When used in a chain:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt_template, memory=memory)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory is critical for applications like chatbots, copilots, or multi-turn reasoning agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools** allow LLMs to interact with external systems—APIs, web search engines, internal databases, or third-party services. LangChain supports tool integration via descriptors that let agents reason about what tool to use and when.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of tools:**\n",
    "- Google/Bing search\n",
    "- DomainTools, VirusTotal, Wikipedia\n",
    "- Custom internal APIs (e.g., threat intelligence, ticketing systems)\n",

    "### Chains\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chains** are workflows composed of modular steps. Each chain links one or more components (e.g., prompt → LLM → post-processor).\n",
    "\n",
    "Common chain types include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `LLMChain`: single prompt-response (Note: LLMChain is deprecated in favor of LCEL - LangChain Expression Language)\n",
    "- `SimpleSequentialChain`: sequential chaining of steps\n",
    "- `MultiInputChain`: accepts multiple inputs\n",
    "- `RouterChain`: dynamically selects downstream chains based on input\n",
    "\n",
    "Example with memory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt_template, memory=ConversationBufferMemory())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Chains provide structure and allow you to build reliable pipelines with conditional logic and state.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agents** enable dynamic, reasoning-driven workflows. Unlike static chains, agents interpret user input, determine which tools or sub-chains to invoke, gather additional data, and synthesize final responses.\n",
    "\n",

       "**LummaC2: A Sophisticated, Multi-Stage Cyber-Espionage Tool**\n",
       "\n",
       "LummaC2 (formerly known as “TRASH”) is a highly advanced, modular cyber-espionage tool developed by the Russian-linked APT group known as “Vandyr.” It’s significantly more complex than many common malware families, making it a particularly concerning threat. Here’s a breakdown of what makes it notable:\n",
       "\n",
       "**1. Modular Architecture:** This is the key differentiator. Unlike many malware families that are single, monolithic programs, LummaC2 is built around a modular design. This means it’s comprised of several distinct components, each performing a specific function.  These modules work together to achieve the overall goal of espionage. This modularity provides several advantages to the attackers:\n",
       "\n",
       "   * **Flexibility:** Attackers can easily swap out modules, allowing them to quickly adapt to new environments and targets.\n",
       "   * **Stealth:** The modular design makes it harder for security analysts to identify and understand the entire scope of the attack.\n",
       "   * **Persistence:** Multiple modules can ensure the malware remains active even if one component is detected and removed.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. Stages of Operation (Typical Lifecycle):**  LummaC2 generally operates through several stages:\n",
       "\n",
       "   * **Initial Access:**  This could involve phishing emails, compromised websites, or exploiting vulnerabilities in software.  They have been observed utilizing various techniques.\n",
       "   * **Beaconing:** Once inside a network, LummaC2 establishes a persistent connection (a \"beacon\") back to the command-and-control (C2) server.  This beacon allows the attackers to remotely control the infected system.\n",
       "   * **Data Exfiltration:** The core espionage function. LummaC2 is designed to steal sensitive data. It targets specific data based on the targets' profiles – government agencies, defense contractors, and critical infrastructure are frequently targeted.\n",
       "   * **Credential Theft:** LummaC2 actively attempts to steal credentials (usernames, passwords, etc.) to maintain access and escalate privileges.\n",
       "   * **Lateral Movement:** After establishing initial access, LummaC2 attempts to move laterally through the network to gain access to more systems and data.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "**3. Key Features & Technical Details:**\n",
       "\n",
       "   * **Multi-Protocol C2:** It uses multiple protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, DNS) for communication with its C2 server. This makes it harder to detect by blocking only one protocol.\n",
       "   * **Dynamic DNS:** To avoid being blocked, LummaC2 uses dynamic DNS services to ensure the C2 server’s address remains consistent.\n",
       "   * **PowerShell-based Modules:**  A significant portion of its functionality relies on PowerShell, which allows for deep integration with Windows systems.\n",
       "   * **Anti-Analysis Techniques:**  LummaC2 employs techniques to evade detection during analysis, such as process injection and obfuscation.\n",
       "\n",
       "**4. Threat Intelligence & Targets:**\n",
       "\n",
       "   * **Russian-linked APT:**  Almost exclusively attributed to Vandyr, a group often associated with Russian intelligence services.\n",
       "   * **High-Value Targets:** Primarily focuses on government, defense, and critical infrastructure sectors.  Specific targets have included defense contractors and organizations dealing with sensitive information.\n",

    "But LLMs are cold and heartless (technically, they are stateless but we are talking about my feelings here). This means that they don’t ‘remember’ interactions from prompt to prompt. You can fine tune them to persist data but without updating the weights through expensive training but, they don’t ‘remember’ anything more after the model is set at a checkpoint. This means if I just asked what the Qakbot malware was and then follow up with a question like \"What industry was primarily targeted by this malware?\", the model will not be able to answer within the context of Qakbot...since show beats tell, let's see how that works firsthand."

It’s a really interesting and quite sophisticated piece of malware that’s been tracked by analysts at Sophos. Essentially, it's a modular, multi-stage post-exploitation framework primarily targeting Windows systems.\\n\\nHere’s a breakdown of what makes it notable:\\n\\n*   **Developed by the Chinese APT group, UNC3923:**  Sophos has linked it very strongly to this group, which is known for its espionage activities, often targeting the energy, defense, and technology sectors. They’ve been tracking this group for a *long* time – back to 2018 – and LummaC2 is a key component of their toolkit.\\n\\n*   **Modular Design:** This is a *big* deal. LummaC2 isn't just one piece of malware; it’s composed of several modules that can be used individually or combined. This makes it highly adaptable and difficult to detect. The main modules include:\\n    *   **Beacon:** This is the core module. It’s a C2 (Command and Control) beacon that allows the attackers to communicate with the infected host. It uses TLS encryption for secure communication – they’re not sending data in the clear. The beacon itself utilizes multiple protocols – HTTP, HTTPS, and even DNS – to evade detection.\\n    *   **Credential Dumping:** This module attempts to steal credentials (usernames, passwords, hashes) from the infected system. They've been observed using tools like Mimikatz – a very common tool for credential theft.\\n    *   **Process Injection:** They use this to inject malicious code into legitimate running processes, further expanding their control over the system.\\n    *   **Privilege Escalation:** LummaC2 attempts to escalate privileges on the infected system, allowing them to gain higher levels of control.\\n    *   **Lateral Movement:** This is crucial.  Once they have control of one machine, they use it to move laterally across the network, compromising other systems.  They’ve been observed using tools like PsExec for this.\\n\\n*   **TLS Encryption:** As I mentioned before, the beacon uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption. This makes it harder for security analysts to monitor the communication and understand what the malware is doing in real-time.\\n\\n*   **Observed Targets:** They’ve been actively targeting companies in the defense, energy, and technology sectors – specifically those with a global presence.\\n\\n*   **Sophos Tracking:** Sophos has been diligently tracking LummaC2's activity since 2021, publishing detailed reports on its behavior and associated IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) – like IP addresses, domains, and file hashes – that security teams can use to detect and block the malware. They even have a dedicated threat feed for LummaC2. You can find a lot of detailed information on their website here: [https://www.sophos.com/threat-center/lummac2.html](https://www.sophos.com/threat-center/lummac2.html)\\n\\nDo you want me to delve deeper into a specific aspect of LummaC2, such as its modules, the IOCs, or how Sophos tracks it?

They’ve seen a significant number of campaigns directed at organizations involved in defense technology – think things like missile defense systems or cybersecurity products – and companies involved in energy production and distribution. It's not that other industries weren't *ever* targeted, but those three were the most frequent and impactful.\\n\\nDo you want me to elaborate on *why* these sectors were particularly attractive to UNC3923, or perhaps discuss the specific types of data they were seeking within those industries? Or would you like me to go back and explain a particular module in more detail, like the lateral movement capabilities?</td>\n",

       "0  Okay, let’s talk about LummaC2! It’s a really interesting and quite sophisticated piece of malware that’s been tracked by analysts at Sophos. Essentially, it's a modular, multi-stage post-exploitation framework primarily targeting Windows systems.\\n\\nHere’s a breakdown of what makes it notable:\\n\\n*   **Developed by the Chinese APT group, UNC3923:**  Sophos has linked it very strongly to this group, which is known for its espionage activities, often targeting the energy, defense, and technology sectors. They’ve been tracking this group for a *long* time – back to 2018 – and LummaC2 is a key component of their toolkit.\\n\\n*   **Modular Design:** This is a *big* deal. LummaC2 isn't just one piece of malware; it’s composed of several modules that can be used individually or combined. This makes it highly adaptable and difficult to detect. The main modules include:\\n    *   **Beacon:** This is the core module. It’s a C2 (Command and Control) beacon that allows the attackers to communicate with the infected host. It uses TLS encryption for secure communication – they’re not sending data in the clear. The beacon itself utilizes multiple protocols – HTTP, HTTPS, and even DNS – to evade detection.\\n    *   **Credential Dumping:** This module attempts to steal credentials (usernames, passwords, hashes) from the infected system. They've been observed using tools like Mimikatz – a very common tool for credential theft.\\n    *   **Process Injection:** They use this to inject malicious code into legitimate running processes, further expanding their control over the system.\\n    *   **Privilege Escalation:** LummaC2 attempts to escalate privileges on the infected system, allowing them to gain higher levels of control.\\n    *   **Lateral Movement:** This is crucial.  Once they have control of one machine, they use it to move laterally across the network, compromising other systems.  They’ve been observed using tools like PsExec for this.\\n\\n*   **TLS Encryption:** As I mentioned before, the beacon uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption. This makes it harder for security analysts to monitor the communication and understand what the malware is doing in real-time.\\n\\n*   **Observed Targets:** They’ve been actively targeting companies in the defense, energy, and technology sectors – specifically those with a global presence.\\n\\n*   **Sophos Tracking:** Sophos has been diligently tracking LummaC2's activity since 2021, publishing detailed reports on its behavior and associated IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) – like IP addresses, domains, and file hashes – that security teams can use to detect and block the malware. They even have a dedicated threat feed for LummaC2. You can find a lot of detailed information on their website here: [https://www.sophos.com/threat-center/lummac2.html](https://www.sophos.com/threat-center/lummac2.html)\\n\\nDo you want me to delve deeper into a specific aspect of LummaC2, such as its modules, the IOCs, or how Sophos tracks it?  Or perhaps you’d like to discuss how to defend against attacks from this group?  \n",

While LummaC2 has been observed targeting a *range* of industries, the primary targets have consistently been the defense, energy, and technology sectors. As I mentioned before, Sophos has specifically noted a strong focus on companies with a global presence within those industries. They’ve seen a significant number of campaigns directed at organizations involved in defense technology – think things like missile defense systems or cybersecurity products – and companies involved in energy production and distribution. It's not that other industries weren't *ever* targeted, but those three were the most frequent and impactful.\\n\\nDo you want me to elaborate on *why* these sectors were particularly attractive to UNC3923, or perhaps discuss the specific types of data they were seeking within those industries? Or would you like me to go back and explain a particular module in more detail, like the lateral movement capabilities?  "

Nov 20, 2025 · A honeybee is any of a small group of social bees that make honey . All honeybees live together in nests or hives. There are two honeybee sexes, male and female, and two female castes. The best-known honey bee species is the western honey bee (Apis mellifera), which was domesticated and farmed (i.e. beekeeping) for honey production and crop pollination. The only other domesticated species is the eastern honey bee (Apis cerana), which are raised in South, Southeast and East Asia. Simply, a Honey Bee is a small vegetarian insect which lives in a highly structured colony with thousands of its sisters (and a few brothers along with one Queen), all working toward the goal of storing enough food (honey) for the winter when flowers are not present. Jun 12, 2017 · Bees spend their lives collecting pollen, which provide a source of protein to their developing youngsters. As pollen collects on their hairy legs, they move some of the pollen from the male to the female part of a flower. We hypothesize that native bees can supplement or even replace the honeybee in apple and other fruit and vegetable pollination in Georgia.

    "The real power of agents is when they are allowed to reason about which tools can be used to solve different tasks or sub-tasks to respond to a prompt.

    "Tool Selection → Based on tool descriptions, the LLM selects appropriate tool(s)\n",
    "Tool Execution → The selected tools are executed with parameters from the LLM\n",
    "Result Synthesis → The LLM combines tool outputs into a coherent response\n",
    "Hopefully, the model decides correctly and you get great results. Sometimes you have to prompt the model to use the right tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a model is trying to solve a math problem without using your math-specific tool, you can just add \"You are bad at math so always use the wolfram tool to solve math problems\" in the prompt. Simple guidance like this is usually enough to get the model working the way you intend.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reasoning ability to select appropriate tools creates a flexible system that can handle diverse queries by combining specialized tools with general language understanding. The agent can break down complex problems, identify which tools would be most helpful for each component, and then integrate the results into a coherent response."

The code loads PDF documents, splits them into manageable chunks, creates vector embeddings using AWS Bedrock or HuggingFace models, and stores them in a persistent ChromaDB database. It showcases two key RAG functionalities: (1) direct similarity search to retrieve relevant document chunks based on semantic meaning, and (2) question answering that leverages the retrieved context to generate accurate responses using an LLM. This implementation includes fallback options, proper error handling, and performance testing to ensure reliable operation even if the primary embedding service encounters issues. The system persists the vector database to disk, allowing for reuse without regenerating embeddings in future sessions."
